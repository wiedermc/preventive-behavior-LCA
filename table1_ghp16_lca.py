Table 1. Mean (SD) scores for each item of the 16-item Good Health Practices (GHP-16) scale,
stratified by latent class of preventive health behavior (n = XXXX).
Values represent means and standard deviations. Higher scores indicate more frequent engagement in the respective behavior.
Latent class membership was identified using Gaussian mixture modeling on rescaled GHP-16 items.
Class labels are for descriptive purposes only and do not imply rank or order.
