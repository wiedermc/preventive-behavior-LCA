**Latent Class Analysis of Preventive Health Behavior Using GHP-16 in a Multilingual Population Sample**

This repository documents the analysis code and macrodata from a population-based study applying latent class analysis (LCA) to preventive health behavior patterns in South Tyrol, a culturally and linguistically diverse region of northern Italy. Preventive behaviors were assessed using the Good Health Practices scale (GHP-16), with additional predictors including health literacy, patient activation, mistrust in health information, and sociodemographic characteristics.

## Objectives

- Identify behavioral subgroups via latent class analysis of GHP-16 items
- Examine the role of gender, patient activation, mistrust, and social context in class membership
- Compare preventive health engagement across latent classes and by sex
- Highlight implications for targeted intervention strategies in multilingual populations
